Welcome to BIO439 / 539: Big Data Analysis

This course is intended to help you learn how to analyze large datasets correctly and efficiently. We will discuss methods for analysis of big data, and how to get research done more efficiently using basic scientific computing skills. This course will consist of limited lecture time and extensive hands-on time. We will cover data management, statistical methods, task automation, and how to make data analysis clear and reproducible. No prior programming experience is required. Although most of the data will be biological or environmental, the material learned will be fully translatable to other fields.
